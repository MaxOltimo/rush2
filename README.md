Description: Simple Shell Implementation in C

This program implements a simple shell that can execute commands, change directories,
manage search paths, and handle output redirection. The shell supports built-in commands
such as "exit", "cd", and "path". It also allows for executing external commands found
in the specified search paths. The shell continuously prompts the user for input, processes the input, and executes
the appropriate commands. It handles errors gracefully and provides feedback to the user.
